WonderLand

Designed by Shu Kai.

Implemented by Lin Hanzhao, Liang Lu, Ni Xinyi.

This is a webapp we created in Hangzhou Hackathon hosted by Hecaila in Winter, 2015.

The app's name, WonderLand, comes from *Alice in WonderLand*.

We want to create a new app which can record our dreams once we get up as soon as possible. And everyone can choose whether it should be shared with others. We think recording dream is interesting, because most of dreams are which we will never experience in real life. Also sharing dreams with others is also an amazing thing. We implemented this idea about dreams in a hackathon and won the thrid prize.

This webapp uses React Starter Kit as framework, which is a *isomorphic* web app boilerplate.
